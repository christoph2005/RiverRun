Credits Scene updated

Completely new credits algorithm

The code is actually quite sloppy but using it is very easy and the result is pretty decent.

Something to note: The image for each credit object is assumed to be 200x200 pixels

also; the timing for ending the scene isn't automatic as of yet, so if you end the scene too soon, not all the display objects get removed.
